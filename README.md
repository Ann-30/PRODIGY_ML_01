Predicting House Prices Using Linear Regression

Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating house prices based on three key factors: square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. By leveraging linear regression, we create a simple yet effective model that can help in understanding the relationship between these variables and house prices, and provide accurate predictions for potential buyers and sellers.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a linear regression model that can accurately predict house prices using the given features. This model will help stakeholders make informed decisions in the real estate market.

Project Steps
Data Collection:

Gather data on house prices along with the corresponding square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The data can be collected from public datasets, real estate websites, or provided by a real estate agency.

Data Preparation:

Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting any inconsistencies.

Normalize or standardize the data if needed to improve model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the data and the relationships between the features and the target variable (house prices).

Visualize the data using plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

Feature Selection:

Select relevant features (square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms) for the predictive model.

Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Create a linear regression model using scikit-learn and train it on the training set.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2) score.

Analyze the model's predictions and compare them with the actual values in the testing set.

Model Optimization:

Fine-tune the model by experimenting with different hyperparameters and techniques to improve its accuracy.

Predictive Analysis:

Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data points (e.g., new houses with specific square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms).

Deployment:

Implement the model in a web application or a user-friendly interface to allow users to input the features and get predictions for house prices.

Documentation and Reporting:

Document the entire process, including data collection, preparation, model building, evaluation, and deployment.

Create a detailed report summarizing the findings, results, and potential applications of the model.
